# Gesture_recognition
    This is a sample for gesture recognition. Including three types of gesture such as rock scissors and paper. We use a simple CNN net to training the model. Finally, some pictures are used to test its effect.

python hand_test.py ---use this to test the model in yanshee robot.
python capture_data.py ---if you want to add new training data use this file to get them in yanshee robot.
